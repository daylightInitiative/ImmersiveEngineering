Coke and Graphite
Coal stuff
<&coke>Coal Coke is a purified form of carbon similar to charcoal. Coke is created from coal in the <link;coke_oven;Coke Oven>.<br>
It is used in steelmaking of all forms, from the <link;crude_blast_furnace;simplest> to the <link;arc_furnace;most advanced>, and is a better furnace fuel than coal.
<&graphite>Highly Ordered Pyrolytic (HOP) Graphite is a complex, allotrope of graphite used in special engineering constructs.<br>
HOP Graphite Dust is created by compressing eight pieces of Coke Dust in the <link;squeezer;Industrial Squeezer>.
That dust can be then be formed into other shapes in the <link;bottling_machine;Bottling Machine> as shown on the following page.
<&shaping>While graphite plates are used in assembling <link;accumulators;HV Accumulators>, the dust can also be shaped into electrodes, essential for operating the <link;arc_furnace;Arc Furnace>.<br>
Both are made by placing the dust and a matching mold on the conveyor of the Bottling Machine, which packs the dust, saturates it with <link;industrial_fluids;Creosote Oil;creosote_oil> and bakes it into shape.

Other Engineers
Testificate with a Degree
Outside of the comfortable compound of any engineer are others less fortified.<br>
Inside of the villages and towns of the world come a variety of inhabitants who farm and build. Among these come some engineers at the forefront of the field in their towns, pushing against the tide.<br>
Common trades among those that ply designs and devices in the markets of the world are below.<np>
<&engineer> The §lStructural Engineer§r deals in common construction materials such as treated wood, scaffolding, and concrete.<br>
Once they're experienced enough to prospect, they may even sell you a treasure map to a nearby <link;mineral_deposits;Mineral Vein;start>...<br>
The workstation of the Structural Engineer is a §2Turntable§r.<np>
<&machinist>The §lMachinist§r is an expert in metals, mechanics and tools.<br>
They trade in various components and engineering blocks needed for assembling multiblock machinery. Master machinists may even sell heads for powered tools.<br>
The workstation of the Machinist is an §2Engineer's Crafting Table§r.<np>
<&electrician> The §lElectrician§r deals in wires and basic electronics components.<br>
As they get more experienced, their fascination turns to higher voltages, offering pieces of a faraday suit and tesla coils!<br>
The workstation of the Electrician is an §2Engineer's Circuit Table§r.<np>
<&gunsmith>The §lGunsmith§r deals with the recently popular firearms, including blueprints.<br>
Apart from buying gunpowder and offering their skills in ammunition loading, they also manufacture unique component pieces for the <link;revolver;Revolver;start>.<br>
The workstation of the Gunsmith is an §2Engineer's Workbench§r.<np>
<&outfitter> The §lOutfitter§r may not seem like a traditional engineer, although their field of work is no less precise!<br>
Whereas others manufacture components, they instead design unique colour patterns known as <link;shaders;Shaders;start>.<br>
While purchasing elegant materials such as tough fabric, silver and gold, they sell shader grab bags, enabling you to randomly acquire pieces of their craft.<br>
The workstation of the Outfitter is a §2Shader Banner§r, which is created by using a shader on a normal, placed banner.

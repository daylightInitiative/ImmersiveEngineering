Coke Oven
Purity in Pyrolysis
<&recipe>The Coke Oven is the first important machine on the engineer's journey.<br>
The brick oven heats up fuels in a low-oxygen environment, pyrolyzing them into a more carbon-rich version, such as §2Coal Coke§r, or §2Charcoal§r.<np>
A byproduct of this process is <link;industrial_fluids;Creosote Oil;creosote_oil>, which is used as a <link;treated_wood;preservative for wood>. This preserved wood serves as a basic construction material all throughout.<br>
The coking process is §oslow§r, but works in batches, allowing up to §216 pieces of coal§r or §28 wooden logs§r to be processed at the same time.
As such, it's recommended to build multiple ovens and stock them with enough fuel to be efficient.<br>
The Coke Oven can be automated to facilitate a more industrial scale of fuel and oil production.<br>
Items can be inserted and extracted by use of hoppers or <link;conveyor_belts;conveyor belts;conveyor_extract_recipe>.<br>
The creosote oil can be extracted by use of a <link;fluid_pump;fluid pump>, as the oven will §onot§r output it automatically.<np>
<&multiblock>To form a Coke Oven, arrange 27 of these blocks in a 3x3x3 cube, and right-click one of the sides' center blocks with an Engineer's Hammer.
